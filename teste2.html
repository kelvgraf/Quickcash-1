The cardholder can then make the withdrawal in all ATMs of banks affiliated with the GIM-UEMOA network. Operations can be carried out 7/7 and 24/24h. The card also allows you to make purchases and it functions like a bank account. The amount transferred can be fully or partly withdrawn as needed until exhausted. It is ideal for travelers, students and the unbanked.</p>
